# ig_auto
Sending IG messages at automated time 

Using selenium, created a way to send an Instagram message at a certain date and time to who you want to send to.



Make sure that the IG Tag that you want to send to is someone you recently messaged so that it can find it.

Also, to start it run "python3 -i ig_auto.py" and input "main()"

WARNING:
Does not work if the user has two step verification.

Has to have selenium plugins installed and chromedriver.
